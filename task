
You’ll be building a retro-style Book Club Meetup website using basic HTML.

A basic webpage that tells people:

It's time to gather and discuss our latest read 
When it's happening
What to bring (a copy of the book... and maybe snacks!) 
Where the meetup is 

HTML Elements You’ll Use:
<h1>, <h2>, <h3> for headings
<img> for images (like the book cover or cozy reading setup)
<ul> and <li> for lists (discussion points or items to bring)
<a> for links (maybe to the book’s page or RSVP form)
